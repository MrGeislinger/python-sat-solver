python-sat-solver
=================

An experimental SAT solver based in Python to explore SAT solving algorithms. 
Not intended to be an efficient SAT solver, but instead an exploration of SAT 
solving algorithms and methods.

##Intention: 

> Recreating a SAT solver that can be modified to try different algorithms. 
> Starting with a simple implementation and then expanding further.
