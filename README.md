python-sat-solver
=================

An experimental SAT solver based in Python to explore SAT solving algorithms. 
Not intended to be an efficient SAT solver, but instead an exploration of SAT 
solving algorithms and methods.

##Intention: 

> Recreating a SAT solver that can be modified to try different algorithms. 
> Starting with a simple implementation and then expanding further.


###Specials Thanks 
Much of this code's algorithms were based around the Sahand Saba's simple 
Python SAT solver. Details of his explanation, as well as code, can be found at
